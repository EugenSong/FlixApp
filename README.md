### Notes
Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.

The most difficult task was being able to recall how I am able to pass data from one controller to another. I had to go back into the videos and rewatch it. I'm also working on trying to not memorize the steps but rather understand how each play into the overall creation of the app.

### Notes
Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.

I did not run into any major problems while working on this app. The work-along tutorials in addition to the Yelpy lab helped me familiarize myself with the concepts associated with UITableView and data fetching via API, methods I had not worked with prior to this course. I continue to work on internalizing what I am learning to not forget how to do it.
