### Notes
Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.

I did not run into any major problems while working on this app. The work-along tutorials in addition to the Yelpy lab helped me familiarize myself with the concepts associated with UITableView and data fetching via API, methods I had not worked with prior to this course. I continue to work on internalizing what I am learning to not forget how to do it.
